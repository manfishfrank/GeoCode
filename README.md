# GeoCode
This is my first application I've created using RESTful API's. I'm practicing parsing JSON with C#

A few notes
*I didn't share my google API registration for obvios reasons. You'll need to get your own here https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start then dump the key into the last bit of the requestString string, line 30 of form1.cs
